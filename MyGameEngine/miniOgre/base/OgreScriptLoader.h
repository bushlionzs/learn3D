    @remarks
        Typically classes of this type wish to either parse individual script files
        on demand, or be called with a group of files matching a certain pattern
        at the appropriate time. Normally this will coincide with resource loading,
        although the script use does not necessarily have to be a ResourceManager
        (which subclasses from this class), it may be simply a script loader which 
        manages non-resources but needs to be synchronised at the same loading points.
    @par
        Subclasses should add themselves to the ResourceGroupManager as a script loader
        if they wish to be called at the point a resource group is loaded, at which 
        point the parseScript method will be called with each file which matches a 
        the pattern returned from getScriptPatterns.
