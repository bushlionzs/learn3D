For the pop-up points a window with animations directly defined in the look n' feel file was made. The animations are triggered by firing events and when the pop-up animation is over the event handler will react to this and subsequently the window will be deleted as defined in the C++ code."

CEGUI Fonts have size and autoscale settings that can be adjusted in the demo. In CEGUI fonts can be loaded using the &quot;.font&quot; files or can be created in run-time using the CEGUI::FontManager. They can be edited at any time.

When characters are requested to be displayed for the first time, CEGUI might need a short time to create them. This load-time only occurs once and is only significant for big character sets, such as for Asian languages with a broad set of characters."
