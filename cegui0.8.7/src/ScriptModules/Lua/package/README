This directory contains the tolua++ .pkg files used to generate the bindings.
We now use a custom tolua++ parser to allow exception handling.

To generate the bindings, would must build the 'tolua++cegui' binary in
'cegui_mk2/ScriptingModules/CEGUILua/tolua++bin', and use it something like this:

	../../tolua++bin/tolua++cegui -o ../src/lua_CEGUI.cpp -L exceptions.lua CEGUI.pkg

It's important to execute 'exceptions.lua' and it will fail if you don't as the .pkg
files rely on the the exception types defined in that file.
